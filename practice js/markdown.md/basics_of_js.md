# Introduction to JavaScript
JavaScript is a versatile programming language primarily used to create interactive and dynamic content on websites. It allows developers to implement features like image sliders, form validations, interactive maps, and much more.

Originally developed for web browsers, JavaScript is now also used on servers (via Node.js) and for building mobile apps and desktop applications.

# Key Features:
Client-side execution: Runs directly in the browser

Lightweight and fast

Supports event-driven programming

Interacts with HTML and CSS to manipulate web content

JavaScript is an essential skill for web development and is supported by all modern browsers.

# History of JavaScript
JavaScript was created in 1995 by Brendan Eich, a developer at Netscape Communications. It was initially developed in just 10 days and was originally called Mocha, then renamed to LiveScript, and finally JavaScript — partly as a marketing move to ride on the popularity of Java at the time, even though the two languages are quite different.

# Key Milestones:
1995: JavaScript is created and released with Netscape Navigator 2.0.

1996: JavaScript is submitted to ECMA International for standardization.

1997: ECMAScript 1 (the first official JavaScript standard) is released.

2009: Node.js is introduced, allowing JavaScript to run on servers.

2015: ECMAScript 6 (also known as ES6 or ES2015) is released, bringing major improvements like let, const, arrow functions, classes, and modules.

2016–present: JavaScript continues to evolve with yearly updates (ES2016, ES2017, etc.), adding new features and enhancements.

# Fun Fact:
Despite its rushed beginnings, JavaScript has grown to become one of the most popular and widely-used programming languages in the world today.
